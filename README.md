# Pensamiento Computacional - Final Project

Within this repository there are different files, which all compile the final project for this course, Pensamiento Computacional. When run, part of the code shall convert a music sheet into an audio in wave format. Another part is dedicated to the communication between the computer and an electric xylophone, which converts the same music sheet into a list of objects which represent each note that can be received by the physical instrument, and can be read by the xylophone in order for the song to be played.
